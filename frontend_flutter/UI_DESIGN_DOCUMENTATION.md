## Implementation Guidelines

### Using the Theme Toggle
```dart
// Access theme provider
final themeProvider = Provider.of<ThemeProvider>(context);

// Toggle theme
themeProvider.toggleTheme();

// Check current theme
bool isDark = themeProvider.isDarkMode;
```

### Applying Consistent Styling
All UI components automatically inherit the theme. For custom styling:
```dart
final theme = Theme.of(context);

// Use theme colors
color: theme.colorScheme.primary
color: theme.colorScheme.secondary
color: theme.colorScheme.tertiary

// Use theme text styles
style: theme.textTheme.displayLarge
style: theme.textTheme.titleLarge
style: theme.textTheme.bodyMedium
```

### Adding Animations
```dart
// For scale animations
AnimationController _controller;
Animation<double> _scaleAnimation;

// For smooth transitions
AnimatedContainer(
  duration: const Duration(milliseconds: 300),
  // ... properties
)

// For page transitions
Hero(
  tag: 'unique-tag',
  child: YourWidget(),
)
```
